### Intro

I won't pull your leg, I have primarily been a Windows user my whole life.  Before I lose any die hard Linux readers, I will also say that I love Linux, like, A LOT!  Since I like to play PC games and have worked places that have huge Microsoft footprints I have just spent more time in the Windows world (_for better or worse_).  Since this is the case, and I live around so much .Net based **stuff**, that is why I learned PowerShell awhile back.

I have _**exstatic**_ since PowerShell Core (_and .Net Core_) released and brought a era of open source cross platform goodness to Windows, Linux, and Mac!

I still play PC games, but despite that I have decided that I am going to live as a Linux user henceforth, only booting into Windows to play games that can't run on Linux yet natively.
