## Lets Get Plastered!

This was my topic for the PowerShell Summit 2018, and honestly something quite useful (we use it at work).  Today we're going to get plastered, but it's likely we'll remember the whole night, or at least wake up groggy with a new found skill of scaffolding projects using PowerShell's Plaster module, here we go!

Follow Along Requirements:
  - [Visual Studio Code][VSCode] Installed (With the PowerShell extension)

### What's a Plaster?

Plaster is a PowerShell module which allows you to scaffold other projects using a **Plaster template**.  A Plaster template is driven by a **Plaster manifest** and when invoked guides you through a series of options to build out a project.  This is particularly useful if you are needing to setup a PowerShell module project but spending a lot of time setting up the directory structure, manifest files, pester test files, etc.

### Install the Dang Module

Okay folks, this might be review of basic PowerShellGet stuff but if it's not this will get you plastering with Plaster, and trust me it's a lot more fun than that plastering they do on _This Old House_!

We're going to go ahead and install the module from the [PowerShell Gallery][PowerShellGallery]!  Of course we'll install with the "Current User" scope to install to our user profile modules directory, because we all have two accounts, _(standard and admin)_ and never operate as Administrator all the time, right?![^1]

```powershell
Find-Module -Name Plaster | Install-Module -Scope CurrentUser
```

Plaster is also compatible with PowerShell Core, which cool cats like myself like to use these days.  It also works with Windows PowerShell 5.x, so don't sweat the version of PowerShell you're running!

With it installed (*at the time of writing this the current version is 1.1.3*) let's take a look at what this module ships with!

```powershell
Get-Command -Module Plaster
```

_Console Output Below_

```text
PS> Get-Command -Module Plaster

CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                                               -------    ------
Function        Get-PlasterTemplate                                1.1.3      Plaster
Function        Invoke-Plaster                                     1.1.3      Plaster
Function        New-PlasterManifest                                1.1.3      Plaster
Function        Test-PlasterManifest                               1.1.3      Plaster
```

You'll see it's relatively simple, just 4 functions.  I mentioned above that Plaster ships with some Plaster templates in the box (*2 of them to be exact*).  Let's take a look at what we have.

```powershell
Get-PlasterTemplate
```

_Console Output Below_

```text
PS> Get-PlasterTemplate

Title        : AddPSScriptAnalyzerSettings
Author       : Plaster project
Version      : 1.0.0
Description  : Add a PowerShell Script Analyzer settings file to the root of your workspace.
Tags         : {PSScriptAnalyzer, settings}
TemplatePath : C:\Users\ephos\Documents\PowerShell\Modules\Plaster\1.1.3\Templates\AddPSScriptAnalyzerSettings

Title        : New PowerShell Manifest Module
Author       : Plaster
Version      : 1.1.0
Description  : Creates files for a simple, non-shared PowerShell script module.
Tags         : {Module, ScriptModule, ModuleManifest}
TemplatePath : C:\Users\ephos\Documents\PowerShell\Modules\Plaster\1.1.3\Templates\NewPowerShellScriptModule
```

These are the two that we get included, and boy howdy there's even one for scaffolding a PowerShell module project, neat-o!  You can see that Plaster templates give us the ability to do some nifty things with them like version and tag[^2] them.

The important thing to note about Plaster templates is that they are very dependant on the _TemplatePath_ of where they reside[^3].  In our example above, you can see these two reside inside of the Plaster module itself which was installed into my user profile modules directory (_for PowerShell core_).

Now that we know how to install Plaster, and how to discover some Plaster templates to use, let's take this thing for a spin.

### Use the Built In Plaster Template

We're going to create a new module called "_**PSEphos**_", mostly because I am not original with names at all!

To do this we'll utilize the included Plaster template "New PowerShell Manifest Module" to build out the module.  As mentioned, the Plaster template path is very important and we're going to need that right now, so if you're playing along at home go ahead and get that _TemplatePath_ property from that Plaster template for the `-TemplatePath` parameter.

We're also going to need to tell Plaster where to create this new PowerShell module, a "destination path" if you will.  It just so happens that there is a parameter called `-DestinationPath` for this.  To keep things relatively simple the desktop will work just fine for this demo.

Let's store these in variables so our actual calling of Plaster is a bit cleaner and the line of code won't reach the moon and back (yes you can also splat this, if that strikes your fancy, I'm not going to cover splatting here though).

```powershell
# The path to the Plaster template that we're invoking.
$templatePath = "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\PowerShell\Modules\Plaster\1.1.3\Templates\NewPowerShe
llScriptModule"

# The destination path where we are going to scaffold the module, remember we are calling it 'PSEphos'.
$destinationPath = "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\PSEphos\"

# Invoke that sucker!
Invoke-Plaster -TemplatePath $templatePath -DestinationPath $destinationPath
```

Holy smoke stacks!  You should be greeted with a sweet looking Plaster logo and now be in a series of prompted questions!

Now for the fun part, answering the questions!  The first question is _"Enter the name of the module:"_, we're going to stick with **PSEphos**.

The second question is _"Enter the version number of the module (0.0.1)"_.  The first thing to point out is that a choice showing parenthesis `()` means that's going to be the default selection if you just hit enter.  In this case if we don't type a version in, it's going to assume "0.0.1" is good enough for us.  Let's give it something different, we'll go ahead and say this is version **1.0.0** so we'll type that in.

The final prompt is actually a choice _Select an editor for editor integration (or None):_.  Here we're presented 2 options, we can hit **?** to find out more about the two options.  Ah, so we can select **N** for no editor integration, or select **C** for VSCode editor integration.  I love VSCode so we'll definitely take option **C**!

![Plaster2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-4-30-Lets-Get-Plastered/Plaster1.gif)

We have a brand spanking new module on the desktop now, ready for us to start writing functions in.  One thing that might have been easy to miss was the 'Verify'.  This ensured we had minimum version of Pester 4.0.3 installed.

```powershell
# Double check out module is on the desktop where we created it.
Get-ChildItem -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\PSEphos\"

# Open VSCode to add a function to it.
code "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\PSEphos\"
```

Let's check out our new module.

![Plaster2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-4-30-Lets-Get-Plastered/Plaster2.gif)

Would you look at that, a module built for us, ready to go for us to start coding in.  We hardly had to lift a finger.  A couple of things to note...

1. It created Pester tests for us, and even populated the `$ModuleManifestName = 'PSEphos.psd1'` variable with our module manifest file.
2. It created a module manifest file as well, complete with the `RootModule`, `Version` _(the version 1.0.0 we specified)_, `GUID`, `Author`, etc.

This is cool, but this module is also a little too basic for my needs.  Let's create a more robust one.  First, however, let's take a look at the inner workings of what made this possible, the üëê**Plaster Manifest**üëê.

_If you'd like to believe this is just pure magic please stop reading here._

### The Plaster Manifest

Okay folks, let's talk turkey. By this I mean Plaster manifest turkey.  This file (**plasterManifest.xml**) single handedly is what makes all of what you saw possible.  It's also responsible for making Plaster templates so much more customizable!

All of what I am about to cover can also be found in the help!

```powershell
Get-Help -Name about_Plaster_CreatingAManifest
```

Recall that Plaster had two built-in templates which shipped with the module.  Let's pry the "New PowerShell Manifest Module" Plaster template open and check out the guts of it.

```powershell
# I want to illustrate the kind of lack of discoverability though with Plaster templates resulting in the need to use Where-Object
$template = Get-PlasterTemplate | Where-Object {$_.Tags -contains 'Module'} | Select-Object -Property TemplatePath
# Open it in VS Code
code $template.TemplatePath
```

Just for reference, the layout of the Plaster templates is very flexible, the module one we're looking at is the following.

```text
NewPowerShellScriptModule     - This is the root of the Plaster template
‚îÇ   Module.psm1               - This is the file that will used to scaffold the <modulename>.psm1
‚îÇ   plasterManifest.xml       - This is the manifest which orchestrates the user choices and the scaffolding
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄeditor                    - This is a directory which houses some of the editor options
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄVSCode                - This is the folder which will become .vscode in the scaffolded module
‚îÇ           settings.json     - This is a VS Code file which will be scaffolded within the .vscode folder
‚îÇ           tasks.json        - This is a VS Code file which will be scaffolded within the .vscode folder
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄtest                      - This is a directory which houses the Pester test which gets scaffolded
        Module.T.ps1          - This is the file which will become the <modulename>.Tests.ps1
```

A handful of files are contained within the Plaster template, but we're going to focus in at first on the _plasterTemplate.xml_ file.

The first thing you might notice, even before opening the file up is that yes... it's, _**dun dun dun**_ XMLüò±!
After the last sentence I have a funny image in my head of the Space Balls evacuation scene, except with this blog entry.  However, if you're still tuned in with us let's take a look at the plasterManifest.xml.

First thing, I really want to stress, XML isn't *all that bad*.  Would I prefer something more relaxed like yaml or json?  Probably, but they can't really enforce a schema well, and Plaster has it's own XML schema[^4], and it's easy as heck to use/learn.

The schema for a Plaster manifest is really just 3 parts...

- metadata
  - *The information about the Plaster template itself, the properties you see when running `Get-PlasterTemplate`.*
- parameters
  - *The choices that prompted when running `Invoke-Plaster`.  In our case the Name, Version, and Editor options.*
- content
  - *The meat and potatoes of what files will be created and/or modified when scaffolded.  This is largely fed by the selected options from parameters.*

Even within those sections, you have a few easy options and I have something that will make it way easier if you stick around!

Let's look at some of the sections from the plasterManifest.xml of the template we just ran.

#### The "metadata" Section

If we look at the top of the file you'll notice the metadata, which is some of the data we see when we run `Get-PlasterTemplate`.  This is pretty self explanatory.

```xml
<metadata>
  <name>NewPowerShellScriptModule</name>
  <id>2a7c3f58-4a45-4d55-9b07-753ac7608114</id>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
  <title>New PowerShell Manifest Module</title>
  <description>Creates files for a simple, non-shared PowerShell script module.</description>
  <author>Plaster</author>
  <tags>Module, ScriptModule, ModuleManifest</tags>
</metadata>
```

#### The "parameters" Section

The next section is parameters.  If you recall we were prompted a few questions.  Let's investigate the parameters.  Since there were only three we'll look at all of them.

```xml
<parameter name='ModuleName' type='text' prompt='Enter the name of the module'/>

<parameter name='Version' type='text' prompt='Enter the version number of the module' default='0.0.1'/>

<parameter name='Editor' type='choice' prompt='Select an editor for editor integration (or None):' default='1' store='text' >
  <choice label='&amp;None' help="No editor specified." value="None"/>
  <choice label='Visual Studio &amp;Code' help="Your editor is Visual Studio Code." value="VSCode"/>
</parameter>
```

The first two parameters are very simple; they are just strings and store the inputs for use later in the content section.  You can also see within version that you can define a default value.  In this example the default is set to "0.0.1".

As for the 'Editor' choice parameter, it had a default option of [C] for VS Code.  You can see that defined above with `default='1'` _(index starts at 0, because choice 0 is "None," choice 1 is "Visual Studio Code")_.  You might also notice `&amp;`, this is what was making the choices for the options the letters _([N] and [C])_.  Since the next character after the `&amp;` is a letter, that makes that letter the selector for the choice.  We also utilized the help and you can see the help messages defined with the options.

#### Plaster Variables

Let's talk about Plaster variables, since we'll need to get familiar with them before we dig into the content section.
A minute ago I said...
>"store the inputs for use later in the content section"

...and you might also notice the Editor choice parameter had `value="VSCode"` or `value="None"`.

Parameter values can be referenced inside the Plaster manifest, as well as in the files you will scaffold with the `$PLASTER_PARAM_ParameterName` syntax.  This means that within our plasterManifest.xml file (*and even outside of it*), we can reference the inputs to the choices, in the content section of the file as well as in the files we are scaffolding.

An example of this would be, when we answered the "ModuleName" parameter question earlier on, we could actually reference that with `$PLASTER_PARAM_ModuleName` and its contained value would be _PSEphos_.

If that didn't totally blow your mind, Plaster also ships with a bunch of built-in variables you can use.

- $PLASTER_TemplatePath
- $PLASTER_HostName
- $PLASTER_Date
- $PLASTER_Time
- $PLASTER_Year

#### The "content" Section

With that business out of the way, and now that we know how user is prompted for information and how that information is stored, we can finally look at the content section where a lot of it is used.

The content section, which utilizes information passed in from the parameter section, is responsible for the file layout/contents and structure of the module.
It can also be used for informational messages or validating module dependencies (like Pester).

Within content the big players here are the following.

- newModuleManifest
  - *This is whats used to generate the module manifest / psd1 file.*
- file
  - *This will specify one or more files to copy into the destination folder.*
- templatefile
  - *This will specify one or more files to copy **and expand** into the destination folder.*
- requireModule
  - *This will check to ensure the specified module is installed.*

Remember, parameters can be referenced.  We can clearly see that in the *newModuleManifest* section of *content*.  You can see the parameters referenced as variables here.  You'll need to use `${}` (dollar sign, curly brace) syntax if referencing it within other text, otherwise if you just need the value you can reference it as you would a normal variable.  This shouldn't be confused with sub-expression syntax, although it does feel similar.  This syntax as far as I know is specific to Plaster.

```xml
<newModuleManifest destination='${PLASTER_PARAM_ModuleName}.psd1'
                    moduleVersion='$PLASTER_PARAM_Version'
                    rootModule='${PLASTER_PARAM_ModuleName}.psm1'
                    encoding='UTF8-NoBOM'
                    openInEditor="true"/>
```

When we scaffolded this project the <modulename>.psm1 file was just copied from the Plaster template to the destination unaltered.  Here we can see the file section facilitating that.  You can see it literally reference the Module.psm1 file in the Plaster template as the source, and in the destination when it does that copy it's going to be <modulename>.psm1 (or PSEphos.psm1 in our example).

```xml
<file source='Module.psm1' destination='${PLASTER_PARAM_ModuleName}.psm1' openInEditor="true"/>
```

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, ISE holdouts and VS Code embracers!  The moment you've been waiting for, templatefile!!!  templatefile is some seriously cool magic, this is what lets Plaster not only move files from Plaster template source to destination, but **expand** them.  You might have caught my bolding of expand above as well.  What does this mean?  Well, token replacement!

Okay... cool, but what's token replacement?  Good question, we'll follow the process of what happened in our Pester test file when it was scaffolded.

This was the part of the plasterManifest.xml which was responsible for it.

```xml
<templateFile source='test\Module.T.ps1'
              destination='test\${PLASTER_PARAM_ModuleName}.Tests.ps1' />
```

Like file, templatefile is going to copy the source file in the Plaster template 'test\Module.T.ps1' over to the destination.  You can see because it is referencing the Plaster variable `$PLASTER_PARAM_ModuleName` that when the file gets copied to the destination it's going to be given the new name of '<modulename>.Tests.ps1'.

So that gets the file there with the correct file name, but where did the expansion / token replacement happen?

Inside Pester test that got created the first line was `$ModuleManifestName = 'PSEphos.psd1'` and it was done automatically without our help!

Let's look at line 1 in the source file of the Plaster template (test/Module.T.ps1)...

```powershell
$ModuleManifestName = '<%=$PLASTER_PARAM_ModuleName%>.psd1'
```

Now let's look at line 1 in the destination file of the output (test/PSEphos.Tests.ps1)...

```powershell
$ModuleManifestName = 'PSEphos.psd1'
```

Remember...
>Parameter values can be referenced inside the Plaster manifest, **as well as in the files you will scaffold** with the `$PLASTER_PARAM_ParameterName` syntax.

![Plaster4]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-4-30-Lets-Get-Plastered/Plaster4.gif)

Mind blown, right?  I hope...

Token replacement is referenced within the Plaster template source files using the `<% %>` syntax.  This is not just limited to simple variable insertion, you can throw whole script blocks with logic in these as well.  You can also have more than 1 in a source file.

### Custom Plaster Templates

Let's create our own Plaster template now.  The high you were riding from that amazing token replacement might have just disappeared as you started recalling that you were going to need to write XML.  Stop worrying, this is easy, and don't forget I said I'd make it easier!  We first need to create a plasterManifest.xml file.  This is easy as there was a function that does it for us, _hint hint_ `New-PlasterManifest`[^5].

```powershell
# We'll create the new Plaster manifest, see my foot note [5] about the quirks in this function.

# First we'll create the Plaster manifest's folder and Set-Location into it.
$plasterTemplatePath = New-Item -Path $env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\ -Name CustomModule -ItemType Directory
Set-Location -Path $plasterTemplatePath

# Now we'll create the Plaster manifest file within it.  Like before, there can be a lot of params, so splat if you'd like.
New-PlasterManifest -TemplateName CustomModule -TemplateType Project -TemplateVersion 1.0.0 -Title 'Blog Custom Module' -Tags 'Module'

# We can now see it.
Get-PlasterTemplate -Path $plasterTemplatePath.FullName
```

_Console Output Below_

```text
PS> Get-PlasterTemplate -Path $plasterTemplatePath.FullName

Title        : Blog Custom Module1
Author       :
Version      : 1.0.0
Description  :
Tags         : Module
TemplatePath : C:\Users\ephos\Desktop\CustomModule
```

So far so good, it just created the plasterManifest.xml for us.  We can open up the Plaster template we created in VS Code now.

```powershell
code $plasterTemplatePath
```

All we have is the plasterManifest.xml and, although it's there, it's a little bare.  It did fill out the metadata and generate us a parameter and content section.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<plasterManifest
  schemaVersion="1.1"
  templateType="Project" xmlns="http://www.microsoft.com/schemas/PowerShell/Plaster/v1">
  <metadata>
    <name>CustomModule</name>
    <id>b3cc3a75-ff7e-4f47-be97-215a6d1aded7</id>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <title>Blog Custom Module</title>
    <description></description>
    <author></author>
    <tags>Module</tags>
  </metadata>
  <parameters></parameters>
  <content></content>
</plasterManifest>
```

Now, you could copy chunks out of existing Plaster manifest files, or you could copy examples out of the "about_Plaster_CreatingAManifest" help file.  Or you can use some [Plaster XML VS Code snippets][Snips] I made.  You'll need to copy them into your _'$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets'_ directory, this requires VS Code.

![Plaster5]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-4-30-Lets-Get-Plastered/Plaster5.gif)

Wow.  Just wow.  Look, that pesky XML is practically written for you, just tab your way through it and fill in the blanks!  I **promised** you I would make it easy for you didn't I?  With this in place we can whip up a custom module template in no time at all!

Now that I've showed you an easy way to whip up a template without writing too much XML, we're going to take a trick out of the old cooking show books and skip the to part where the finished meal comes out of the oven!

**Note:** *If there is any interest in a post about writing a whole custom Plaster template and plasterManifest.xml file it is certainly an option but this post ended up pretty long. Instead I opted to outline how Plaster works and reference the module template included in the [Github project from my Summit demo][PlasterCustomModule].*

I like my modules with dot source-able public and private functions, and a module project root for tests and build files that don't get shipped with the module itself when the CICD pipeline builds it.  Something similar to this...

```text
ModuleProjectRoot
‚îÇ   ReadMe.md
|   .gitignore
|   LICENSE
|   ChangeLog.md
|   <CI Build Files for psake/psdeploy/appveyor/etc>
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ.vscode
‚îÇ       settings.json
‚îÇ       tasks.json

‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       PSModule.cs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄen-US
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       about_PSModule.help.txt
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄFunctions

‚îÇ       ‚îÇ       _PrivateFunction.ps1

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄtests
        Manifest.Tests.ps1
        PSModule.Tests.ps1
```

We won't go completely crazy with this as I'd like to provide you a base to get started, but we'll at least do a subset of this so you can get going.

Using my Plaster "CustomModule" template which can be found **[here][PlasterCustomModule]** we'll go ahead and scaffold a more robust module!

We're going to create a module called "PSSuperModule".

![Plaster6]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-4-30-Lets-Get-Plastered/Plaster6.gif)

Just like that, we have a module and can start writing up our public and private functions!

### Non PowerShell Projects

"Can you scaffold non PowerShell projects?".  Yes!

Just as a very simple proof of concept, I have a little [Go][go] application example [here][PlasterGoApp].

If you look at the code you'll notice that it _can_ be a little wonky doing the token replacement in files that won't end up as a PowerShell file but it is _technically_ doable.

```powershell
<%
if ($PLASTER_PARAM_MainPackage -eq 'Main')
{
@"
package main
import (
"@
}
else
{
@"
package $PLASTER_PARAM_ProjectName
import (
"@
}

foreach ($import in $PLASTER_PARAM_Imports)
{
@"
	"$($import)"`r
"@
}

@"
)
func main() {
"@

if ($PLASTER_PARAM_Imports -contains 'fmt')
{
@"
    fmt.Println("Hello, Demo!")
"@
}

if ($PLASTER_PARAM_Imports -contains 'os')
{
@"
	h, err := os.Hostname()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(h)
"@
}

if ($PLASTER_PARAM_Imports -contains 'time')
{
@"
	t := time.Now()
	fmt.Println(t)
"@
}

@"
}
"@
%>
```

This is a little bit rough around the edges but really made to let you see that Plaster is capable of really scaffolding whatever you need.  You may have caught that we were doing this the the [C# file][csharp] in our CustomModule in the last section as well!

### Plaster Templates in the Wild

When you run `Get-PlasterTemplate` you might notice that there is a parameter called `-IncludeInstalledModules`.  It wasn't until March I found a PowerShell module which shipped with a Plaster template!  [Michael Lombardi's][barbariankb] [Documentarian][Documentarian] includes a Plaster template and uses it to generate documentation for PowerShell modules.

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Documentarian -Scope CurrentUser
Get-PlasterTemplate -IncludeInstalledModules
```

_Console Output Below_

```text
PS> Get-PlasterTemplate -IncludeInstalledModules

### Conclusion

Well thats all folks!  I hope you learned something, at the very least you can checkout my [Github][PlasterGithub] project for the presentation I did (and included templates)!  Feel free to hit me up on [Twitter][twitter] if you want to talk some Plaster or PowerShell!

    Yes I run this way at home as well.  Why gamble on a re-install of the OS when I can just run as a non administrative user and just escalate to my admin account when needed?

[^2]:
    Tags are nice but there is no real good way to search for Plaster templates with them.  You'll still need to use `Where-Object` to filter by tag, and it just feels a little... icky.

[^3]:
    This is one of my minor gripes with Plaster.  You tend to work a lot with the TemplatePath(s), which feels a little rough around the edges.  It's not like there is a $PSPlasterTemplatePath environment variable where it knows where to look for them.  Again, this is minor but I personally wish Plaster template discoverability was a bit better.

[^4]:
    If for some reason you're a weird XML schema nerd, you can find the schema definition for Plaster in the [Github][Schema] repository for it.

[^5]:
    There seems to be something very buggy about the `-Path` parameter on this function at the time of writing.  A ton of variations will throw the exception...
    Exception calling "Create" with "2" argument(s): "Could not find a part of the path 'Path\You\Specified'."
