I wanted to finally do something with this idea to start keeping some of my findings in a place where I or others could find them easily.

![Welcome]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2017-1-8-Hello-World/HelloWorld1.PNG)

To start off I wanted to greet everyone with one of my favorite dopey ASCII art images *(with some additional greetings instead of the usual chain mail message)*.

I can tend to be kind of a no fun stiff sometimes with PowerShell code style and PSScriptAnalyzer rules and in true honor of that I chose to `Write-Output` instead of `Write-Host` *(something, something, something dead puppies...  Yes I know PowerShell v5 changed its behavior...)*.

This brings me to my first *real* post idea which is a write up of my favorite free PowerShell resources, one of which is the PoshCode style guide.  I had this idea after posting a reply on ([/r/PowerShell][PowerShellReddit]) asking about a favorite book/training course on PowerShell.  It won't be limited to just style and rules, I also want provide some good resources for folks just getting started as that is a question I also see frequently on Reddit and from colleagues.

Oh yeah... I haven't decided on a theme, and I am also notorious for making tons of small edits, so I forsee many commits/updates to this in the future.
