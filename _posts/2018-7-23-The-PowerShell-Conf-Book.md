### The Book

The PowerShell Conference Book is intended to be a PowerShell conference contained in a book.  Over 30 PowerShell industry professionals have joined up to each write an individual chapter on a conference level PowerShell topic.  I was extremely excited to participate in authoring a chapter myself when [Mike Robbins][Mike Robbins] contacted me with the opportunity.

Probably unsurprisingly by now, my chapter is on Plaster (as that was my PowerShell + DevOps Summit 2018 presentation).  If you pickup the book, which I really hope you do, you can find it in part 3 of the book, _"PowerShell and DevOps"_.  Plaster aside, this book is seriously packed with some amazing content you won't find anywhere else.  Even as an author of a chapter, I am totally engrossed in reading the other chapters that are included in this book.

Onto the best part about this book!

### OnRamp Scholarship Program

The part about this book which I love the most, is that it part of the [Leanpub for Causes][Leanpub for Causes] program.  Better yet, **100%**, yes **100%** of the royalties of this book are donated to the [DevOps Collective][DevOps Collective] and will go toward the [OnRamp Scholarship][OnRamp Scholarship]!

_I am going to make a larger post about the OnRamp program soon!_

I will admit, it was exciting experience to author my first published material that wasn't code or a blog post.  More exciting than the rush of authoring something, is knowing that the royalties from this book will help grow and diversify our industry, and the PowerShell community.

Again, I can't state enough how seriously awesome this book is.  It is packed full of rich content, and you get to support a truly amazing cause by buying it!

### Thank You

I want to take a moment to thank the other authors who took the time to contribute to book! Consider giving these folks a follow and checking out some of the great content they've posted on their blogs!
