### About Me

Hi, I'm Rob.  When I started this I wasn't sure what I really wanted it to be.  As time has passed I have decided that I just hope it helps people.  From the silly tidbits of info that save you time, to the weird quirks you may run into.  My hope is that someone reading somewhere either learns something new, has an "ah ha!" moment, or hopefully just reads something that makes them think.  I'll never claim to know everything, and hopefully I'll learn more from the community and even ***you*** by having this blog!

I love anything related to coding and automation.  Nothing is more enjoyable than watching the things you've built run and come to life from the big projects to even the small one off one liners.  I started with PowerShell, and its still my go to.  I have been known to dabble in C# as a secondary but really enjoy all languages.
