# Be a Buddy

## Calling All OnRamp Buddies!

Hey you!  Yes, you.  You're thinking of going to the **PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit 2019**, maybe it'll be your second year, or third, or perhaps you've been to all of them!

Did you know there is a new program for 2019 called OnRamp?  This is an amazing opportunity, almost a conference within a conference where IT Pros can come and attend the Summit but instead of attending the sessions, get a hands on training from the best of the best!

But wait, there's more!  These attendees will have the option of having a buddy.  What's a buddy you ask?  Good Question!  OnRamp attendees can be buddied up with a Summit attendee.  This will give the OnRamp attendee the following...

- Someone to ask PowerShell questions to as they quickly learn a lot of content.

We've all been there, learning PowerShell can sometimes have topics that don't sink in right away, or it takes you talking to multiple people to really get a handle on it.  Imagine how helpful it would be if you knew that you had a dedicated person, willing to spend a couple minutes with you to really help you figure that one tough concept out!

- Someone to help introduce them to the PowerShell community at the events.

Okay - Let's be honest, and Don has said this more times than I can count now over the few Summits I have attended.  **We're all introverts!** _(or at least most of us...)_  Meeting people might not be the easiest sometimes.  OnRamp attendees will be able to lean on their buddy at the events or the lunches to meet new folks faster.  One thing I cannot stress enough, despite this perk, the PowerShell community overwhelmingly is the warmest, most friendly, helpful group of folks I have ever met.  Given this fact, an OnRamp attendee might meet new folks a little bit easier, but it'll happen either way :) .
