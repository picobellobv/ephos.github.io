## PowerShell + Linux Forever

Ok folks, it's new laptop time for this guy!  I have a brand spankin' new Lenovo Thinkpad T480.  I decided that for the duration of this laptop's life, I am going to try to run only Linux on it.

The most exciting part, picking a distribution.  **Spoiler Alert:** *I almost always end up picking [Arch Linux][arch]...*

Don't get me wrong, I love Windows too.

I am a PowerShell noob by most community standards.  I started learning PowerShell in the PowerShell 2.0 days.
