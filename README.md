# Blog

[**ephos.github.io**](blog) is a knowledge repository by me, for me, and if you happen upon it maybe you too.

## Why?

In a world with hundreds of thousands of blogs I really just wanted a place to store some of my findings, research, and knowledge that was more helpful than my OneNote notebook.
